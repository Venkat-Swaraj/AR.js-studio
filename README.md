# AR.js studio
AR.js Studio is an open-source AR creation platform for building custom augmented reality experiences. You can create location-based or marker-based AR applications and deploy them straight to the web.

# Testing its capabilities

This repository is to check the location-based AR capability of AR.js studio. I have used fighter jet 3D model and place outside of ICT Bhavan of GITAM University.

Try out the experience

## Review/Experience
AR.js Studio is very beginner friendly and easy to get started. One can create AR experience within minutes and host it on GITHUB pages directly.

The tracking is subpar, with noticeable model drifting. In comparison to app-based augmented reality (AR), which offers more reliable tracking, the overall experience is lacking. Additionally, the loading time is extended due to the necessity of downloading assets. Web-based AR and standalone AR each have their own strengths and weaknesses. However, with the growing acceptance of WebGPU, the performance of WebXR should no longer be a concern.

## Future Plans

 - Add the ability to place a 3D model at a particular GPS coordinate in runtime, when the user opens the website
 - Give  user the option to select the 3D model.
 - Give user the option to upload 3D model.
